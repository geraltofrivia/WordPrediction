# WordPrediction
 How ya doin ya'll. Imma be predictin word after word after word so you could get your sorry ass to type in engiish. E en gee english motherfucker, you speak it? No you bet you gonna do!


I'm kidding. This is a project for the course stochastic simulation. 
Here we use basic markov chains to do some word prediction.
If you ever come across this repo and find it useful. I'm glad. I'm also apologetic for the lack of any documentation whatsoever, so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
